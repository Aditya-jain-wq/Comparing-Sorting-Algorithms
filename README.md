This program can help you find best sorting algorithm for your specific data.
You can use this program when you have certain idea about what kind of data usually it would be and that data needs to be sorted on client side.

Some Observations:

Insertion sort can be best when only 2-3 elements are out of place and rest are sorted. (O(n))
If number of elements are around 10-20 insertion could be best.

If number of elements are 2-3 then bubble sort can be amoung best candidates.

If range of numbers are small and number of element are huge then Count Sort can be amoung best candidates.
